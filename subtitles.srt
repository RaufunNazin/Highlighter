1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,080
I and still have a chance of a top eight

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,759
finish in the champions league league

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,280
phase but they have work to do two wins

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
will likely be

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,480
necessary Barcelona up in second

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,160
Barcelona already know that they will be

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,119
in the playoffs at least Benfica well

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,279
they're chasing a top top eight finish

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,279
as well

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,160
struggling to get across to that

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,879
Carreras with the ball there will a oh

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,879
good fer of scored already fire in by

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,520
paves that's an unreal start for the

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,440
Eagles of Lisbon their first attack of

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,840
the game Alvaro Carreras with the

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,239
freedom of the left hand side arm in the

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,239
air play my way that's the way it came

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,000
and look at the runners in the middle

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,760
left alone by shelder up he got the call

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,520
from pavidis who did the rest it's one-

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,280
nil

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Benfica that's what Barcelona will do

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,520
balde pull back by Rafia for

24
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,720
levandowski balde goes down it's going

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,200
to be a corner challenged by Thomas Aro

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,840
was it uh a step on the foot yes it was

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,920
seeing a lot of those in every game that

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,439
we watch at the moment and they're

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,560
always painful yeah they are now should

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,799
it have been any anything more than a

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,799
corner I'm sure it'll be looked

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,280
at nothing more to see oh no there is he

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,920
is being asked goodness me I thought

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
he'd set himself for the corner himself

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,159
the referee but now he's been given the

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,799
uh the flag from V to go and have a look

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,119
for himself so Rob deeping thinks it

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,640
should be a penalty what is Danny mcy

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,000
going to make of it now wow I didn't

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,200
think there was enough in this I'm going

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,840
to watch it again you can see he quite

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,079
clearly knocks the ball around doesn't

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,159
he and he does connect with his foot

44
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,399
he's going to give this guy maybe should

45
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,200
have done first time around yeah cuz he

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,079
was in a good

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,160
position he's not needing much of a look

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,879
there we go a penalty for Barcelona away

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
back into the

50
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,560
game I think it is right I think he does

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
well he just takes it away from the

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,160
defender there and it is that that stamp

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,640
on the

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,840
foot the perfect man to take the penalty

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,840
for

56
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,519
Barcelona and it's more or less the

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,560
perfect penalty Benfica won Barcelona

58
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,360
won

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,760
and we're only 13 minutes in he's just

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
so calm isn't he leandi that little

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,800
stutter sees where the goalkeeper's

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,879
going to go and then he just slots it

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,879
home brilliant penalty from

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,720
him DOI trying to lay it off and it has

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,720
broken here good save from truin to deny

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,599
Gabby this might get them excited again

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,440
where's chesy going oh it's a real mixup

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,080
paves with an open goal Benfica have

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,319
their lead

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,400
back vanelis pavis and the double

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,159
tonight A misjudgment from vek

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
chzn and he's feeling the pain of it

73
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,200
such a mistake you know he doesn't need

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,040
to do that the defender's there the

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,680
defender can cover he's made the

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,200
decision to come out you've got to clear

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
it you've got to get to the ball if

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,920
that's the

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,760
case he's not going to mind though is

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,159
he that's

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,720
Carreras finding kooku who gets it into

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,439
Aus Asus outside of the boot great ball

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,640
Chesney out oh is that going to be

84
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,439
another penalty it is one for Benfica

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,640
this time Chesney was late I think it's

86
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,799
the right decision guy I think it's a

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,120
penalty yeah again this the the ball out

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,079
from the back good pressure from Benfica

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
but look at the spaces that Barcelona

90
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,040
reling lovely ball and you can see just

91
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,239

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,560

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,319
curu is there

95

first nobody was getting the ball from

96
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:19,359
him here vanelis paves 31

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,800

hatrick Benfica fans absolutely

him pedri lines up the shot and it's uh

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,919
nicely saved by trouin and he makes sure

106
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,199
it doesn't spin

107
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,320
away just opened up nicely for for pedri

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,120
but yeah lots of possession for

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Barcelona you can see both the WID men

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,080
are tucking in and it's the fullbacks

111
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
that are trying to to give them the wh

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,160
but great opportunity for PF to counter

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,280
there oh what's happened goodness me

114
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,880
Barcelona have got a goal out of

115
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,360

119
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,240
weirdest goal I've ever seen scored in

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,000
the Champions League yeah me

121
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,520
to Thomas Aro it's a really good ball in

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,479
have le this wasn't far from it shielder

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,639
up and it's

124
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,800
in Ronald Aro has put the ball into his

125
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
own

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,400
net

127
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,199
Carreras pedri for Barcelona into the

128
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,960
feet of fan Torres lamin Mal goes down

129
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,319
and the r gives a

130
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,759
penalty he's also giving a yellow card

131
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:05,479
to otamendi this is not over yet Bar's

132
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,479
second penalty of the

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,720
night and it wasn't in doubt the only

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,560
thing that is now is Benfica holding on

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,560
to get the three points it is 43

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,240
just a bit of room here for Ferman he

137
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,840
just got a yard away from Alexander bar

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,880
who was indebted to the help of Thomas

139
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,199
Aro barer in a

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,800
pedri shifts it Clips it in good ball

141
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,240
and barer a

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,599
level you knew the chance would come

143
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,840
absolutely buried Eric Garcia rising to

144
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:51,039
head in picked out with the perfect

145
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,039
cross into the box oh this is brilliant

146
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,639
from Barcelona it's a short Corner what

147
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,400
a delivery this is just shifts it onto

148
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,360
his right foot just changes that angle

149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,360
and he gets in between two Defenders

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,840
gets up so well and the power is enough

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,840
to take it pass to

152
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,479
brilliant played in for Carreras across

153
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,400
comes to Young and he plays it back

154
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,479
against Carreras and then caught him leg

155
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,360
raised High to stop him getting up and

156
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,759
running free kick Benfica and they look

157
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,440
like the team that are going to have the

158
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,039
last chance to win it if they want to

159
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,759
always high line here we here we go Di

160
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,280
Maria round the back otamendi can't get

161
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:39,680
there this is bar Bar's lift to the

162
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,160
back anonio Silva leaves it for barrero

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,159
comes down for barrero as he

164
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,400
fouled Benfica implore the referee to

165
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,199
give a penalty but he's not going to and

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,960
Barcelona clear where's the goalkeeper

167
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:59,560
troid he's gone back to his line it's

168
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Rafia and Rafia has won it for Barcelona

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,800
I do not believe it from 42 down to a 54

170
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,960
lead with what looks like being the last

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,319
kick of the match this meanwhile is

172
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,400
going to be

173
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,879
checked V are going to have a

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
look to see whether Benfica ought to

175
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,199
have had a

176
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,159
penalty rafine you're not hanging around

177
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,319
to find out he had support he could have

178
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,039
played it across but I think that's what

179
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,200
Benfica were expecting

180
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:39,479
so he catches trit and wrong foots the

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,479
keeper to make it Benfica four Barcelona

182
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,920
five he's the v he's already called his

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,959
colleague Danny mckel over to the screen

184
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,040
once tonight this is
